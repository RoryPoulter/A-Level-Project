Drag - A force which acts against the direction of motion of an object travelling in a fluid
Velocity [m/s] - The initial speed of the projectile
Elevation angle [°] - The angle from the ground a which a projectile is fired
Azimuth angle [°] - The angle between the x and y axes
x, y, z - The starting coordinates (z is the vertical coordinate)
Gravity [m/s²] - The acceleration due to gravity
Mass [kg] - The mass of the projectile
Air density [kg/m³] - The density of the fluid the projectile is travelling through
Drag coefficient - A measure of the effectiveness of a shape in reducing drag
Surface area [m²] - The surface area of the projectile
